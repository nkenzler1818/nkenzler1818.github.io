                    <p>I am a first-generation college student pursuing a Master of Science in Marketing after completing my undergraduate degree in Business Administration, both at the University of Arizona. I am drawn to roles where strategy, communication, and execution come together, especially in fast-paced, high-performing environments.</p>

                    <p>Across operations, marketing support, and client-facing roles, I have developed a practical understanding of how businesses operate day to day. I have managed multiple client relationships at once, supported team operations under pressure, and contributed to early brand and go-to-market efforts.</p>

                    <p>My core strength is critical thinking. I am able to evaluate complex or technical information, identify what truly matters, and form clear, unbiased conclusions. From there, I translate those insights into straightforward, digestible narratives that help teams align. This has allowed me to build trust with clients, support better operational decisions, and contribute more effectively in environments where clarity drives outcomes.</p>

                    <p>Alongside my graduate studies, I am intentionally building a strong analytics and AI foundation through Tableau and SQL certifications while exploring how AI tools and automation can improve marketing workflows and decision-making.</p>

                    <p>What truly draws me to marketing is the blend of human connection and technical expertise it requires. I love taking complex ideas and turning them into clear, actionable insights that people can really use. Thanks to my background, I am able to do this not just with a creative touch, but also with the technical skill and calm under pressure that high-level marketing demands. It is that combination of clarity, impact, and technical finesse that makes me excited to build my career in this field. </p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-accent-muted mb-2">Sep 2023 – Feb 2025, Tucson, AZ</p>
                    <p class="text-white">Coming out of the COVID era as a young professional, this role was a huge step in rebuilding my interpersonal skills and learning how to connect with people from all walks of life. I found myself earning trust from clients who were often older or in tough situations, and I had to prove that I could be the person they relied on. This job taught me how to be that person, to step up, communicate clearly, and use data-driven approaches to keep clients engaged even when they were uncertain. It also reinforced my ability to adapt and keep growing, never assuming I had seen or knew it all, and learning how to handle said situations in the moment and respond and grow when that was the case.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-accent-muted mb-2">Feb 2021 – Jul 2023, Santa Clara, CA</p>
                    <p class="text-white">In this role, I wore a lot of hats, and that versatility was key to my growth. I built up a loyal clientele of over 15 clients, handled everything from scheduling to photography shoots, and managed on-site facility needs. It was a chance to be incredibly hands-on and figure out what I was truly good at. This experience showed me the value of being adaptable and prepared me to pursue my business degree, knowing that I had a strong foundation in client interaction, project management, and figuring things out on the fly.</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-300 text-accent-muted mb-2">Jun 2019 – Feb 2021, Santa Clara, CA</p>
                    <p class="text-white">Nordstrom was my first real job and it taught me what it means to work professionally and collaborate across departments. I learned how to optimize workflows, deliver consistent results under pressure, and focus on adding value beyond my core tasks. This experience was crucial because it set the foundation for my work ethic and taught me how to learn and adapt on the fly. It showed me how to rise to new challenges and succeed, even if it meant going beyond what I was directly told to do. In other words, it taught me how to grow into someone who can handle more than just the basics and really thrive.</p>

                            <p>I have always been drawn to tech as a tool for creativity and optimization. Growing up with an engineer father, I was always encouraged to explore how things work. Whether it was tinkering with PCs, geospoofing a game for fun, or hardwiring cameras, tech became my playground. Now, I’m excited to channel that same curiosity into a professional tech marketing path, where I can combine strategy, creativity, and a lifelong affinity for making things work better.</p>

                            <p>Analytics give me a strong foundation, turning data into clear, strategic decisions. In my time I spent as a candidate for my business administration degree, I learned to leverage wide variety of tools and techniques in order to derive and present conclusions professionally and effectively. Moreover, a reason I’m especially excited about my Master’s program is taking courses such as Marketing Research, where I get hands-on experience with qualitative and quantitative methods to gather and interpret data. On the AI side, I love experimenting. For example, I explore which tools fit best into my workflow; Perplexity for research, Gemini for visual representations, and even building this site by integrating Cline as a wrapper in my IDE while coding with OpenAI’s Codex 5.2. Each step refines how I achieve results and as I alluded to in the question above, I enjoy finding and swapping pieces to bolster my ability to execute an idea to the highest degree!</p>

The key is recognizing what the team needs, adapting, and maximizing everyone’s strengths so we create the best outcomes together.</p>
